This application allows you to view GitHub's "Usage Report" data.

It gives a generic overview of which users and repositories use actions the most and allows each repository to see how many and when workflows are executed.

It is built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python library for building data apps, and pandas, a Python library for data analysis.

Read the [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/viewing-your-github-actions-usage) for download "Usage Report"

*GitHub Actions Analytics is in beta.*
